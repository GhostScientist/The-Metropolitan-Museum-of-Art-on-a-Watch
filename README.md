# The Tiny Met
## Effective Date: 04/28/2024

This Privacy Policy outlines how The Tiny Met handles your data.

### Information Collection
The Tiny Met does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or data from its users. We do not require you to create an account, provide any personal details, or grant any permissions to use our app. The app only makes API calls to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's public API to fetch artwork information.

### Third-Party Libraries and Services
The Tiny Met uses the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Open Access API to fetch artwork data. This interaction is read-only and no user data is transmitted. The app does not share any data with any external entities or services beyond these necessary API calls.

### Data Usage
As The Tiny Met does not collect any user data, we do not use your information for any purposes, including analytics, advertising, or user profiling. The app implements local caching to improve performance, but this data is stored only on your device and is not transmitted elsewhere.

### Data Security
Since The Tiny Met does not handle or store any user data beyond local caching, there is no risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to your personal information. All interactions with the Met's API are done using secure HTTPS connections.

### Children's Privacy
The Tiny Met is suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children or any other users.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy
If we decide to update or modify this Privacy Policy, we will post the changes within the app and update the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy.

### Contact Me
